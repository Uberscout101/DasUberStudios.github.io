        <h1>About Us
        <p>UberStudios is a starting off indy company. We are young developers trying our luck in the game industry. While our first games will be text-based games, we will move on to platformers, RPG's, etc. Our first game, "Verdun: No Man's Land", was a project for a code camp. We hope you enjoy the games that we create! To give feedback, or for all business inquiries, contact USuberstudios@gmail.com.</p>
